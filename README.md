**Learning by doing is often the most effective way**, especially with complex systems like kubernetes. So, created a new series where we delve into Kubernetes internals by troubleshooting and fixing issues to grasp the intricacies of it. It's a hands-on, reverse engineering approach to grasp its complexities/concepts.
